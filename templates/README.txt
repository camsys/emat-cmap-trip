This folder contains TEMPLATE files for use with EMAT.

Each file mirrors a regular script or macro used in the CMAP trip-based model,
but has certain key values replaced by unique tokens.

Each unique token is of the form __EMAT_PROVIDES_XXX__ as this unique pattern
is never used in the original files and makes it easy to search for all the
special tokens in each file.
